# Miscelanous Spring / SpringBoot / Maven Projects of mine


## What's in this repository?


*  see my postfix [Postfix Calculator](postfix-calculator "A Postfix Calculator") project.

>As opposed to regular infix arithmetic expressions such as (a + b), postfix expressions (AKA: ‘Reversed Polish Notation’) are written operands first,
operators later such as (a b +). Postfix calculators can evaluate postfix expressions and calculate results. This is one of those academic calculator
projects, but it (hopefully) brings a new level of configurability to the plain of postfix calculators.

*  see my [Protobuf ZMQ](protobuf-zmq-demo "A Postfix Calculator") project.

>This is a com.google.protobuf and org.zeromq.jeromq project built on Maven project. This project demonstrates a ØMQ Publisher which constantly generates random protobuf messages and packs them over the wire via a ØMQ socket.
The protobuf messages were pre-compiled by protoc compiler from .proto files A ØMQ Subscriber receives the messages and unpacks them to pretty print them as JSON via a logger to the console.


*   My hebrew support contribution for [The Tradukisto](https://github.com/allegro/tradukisto "Tradukisto") project is [here](tradukisto "Hebrew Support for Tradukisto")

>Tradukisto is a library for Java 8+ created to convert numbers to their word representations.
This is my contribution to the project.
